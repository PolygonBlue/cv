  <p>Deep in the recesses of the <a href="https://truenoirstories.wordpress.com/2017/08/04/kenny-veach/">"Kenny's-End"</a> Cave system, I found the latest
  in a bizarre string of clues.  I awoke at 0430 this morning in a vain attempt
  to reach the maw by early 0700, before the sun's heat made things too unbearable
  to travel across the barren <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojave_Desert">Mojave Desert.</a>.</p>
  <p>For me, this all started in late 2018 with none other than an out of place comment on a post I made on reddit. The comment was in response to a post I made
  regarding a bird I was watching.  The comment simply read as "Hay [My Name], it's been a while. we went to high school together way back when. We should catch up; here's my cell [...]."
  Though I'm not exactly the most private individual, I was taken aback that the account knew my name (something I never shared on my reddit account).  After some diliberation, my
  curriosity got the better of me.  I called the number.  What followed was simultaniously intruiging and off-putting.  The phone rang twice before playing a strange pitch-key like 8-bit tone
  (think classic games like mario or space invaders) followed by a string of numbers.  I hastily scrawed them on an old receipt I hadn't tossed from my earlier take out.  The numbers read
  "1.5.6.6.7.1.3.8.1." I was obviously a bit confussed and didn't know what to make of these. After askign around, I found a guy who somehow was able to extrapulate <a href="https://earth.google.com/web/search/34.24809565160192,+-117.51354513864838/@34.24733319,-117.51423517,1009.67414982a,3543.88423859d,35y,-110.18831549h,45.01709347t,0r/data=CmoaQBI6GZ3jkpnBH0FAIVlhROzdYF3AKiYzNC4yNDgwOTU2NTE2MDE5MiwgLTExNy41MTM1NDUxMzg2NDgzOBgCIAEiJgokCXjIUy4p3URAEV9PCw36ju0_GRGlAd6gbmZAITtPRJafNWXA">coordinates</a> out of these
  seemingly random numbers. </p>

  <h3>The First Clue</h3>
  <p>To say I was a <em>little</em> intruiged would be an understatment. That location wasn't too far way and I had some off time built up.  The following weekend, I recruited my brother to tag along
  and we traveled the near three hour trek to this location.  At first, it looked like no more than an empty landscape.  Before long I decided to go to the exact location the coordinates pointed to.
  Luckily I had a spade in my trunk to dig. About 3ft in the dry dirt was a small time capule of sorts.  Therein was a small collection of phones and an assortment of envelopes.  Was this some sort of
  Geo-cashe? I'd never done one before, but knew of them nonetheless. I wasn't keen on just picking up a random phone from a random place.  Who knows wth is on that thing. The FBI might be looking for
  it for all I know. I the end, I picked up a phone and turned it on.  Below I've included a picture of the sceene.</p>
