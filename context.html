  <body>
    <p>For the most part, this site is an experiment in concepts.  I am simultaniously
    building both a world full of lore and puzzles <em>and</em> a website viewable to the
    irl world at large (eventually?).  This also can act as a blog of sorts for me.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Furthermore, since this website isn't schedule do go online any time soon,
    I can abide it being a mish-mash of diffrent things and all together chaotic. <br>
    Topics may include (but not be limited to):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>ARG crafting</li>
        <li>Personal Thoughts and ideas</li>
        <li>OPSEC and Online Privacy</li>
        <li>D&D stuff</li>
        <li>Other such nerdy things</li>
        <br>

        <!-- making all the nerd stuff my realm here - fight me! --!>
